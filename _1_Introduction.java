       // a feature in java which allow us to define a method of and interface without using a separate class

       // suppose we have defined an interface A  as all the methods inside the interface are public 

       // here we can only use interface A as a reference

       /*   But there is a problem here if you see class A the whole purpose of this class is just to implement A*/


       //// there is no other purpose of this class  if you have this scenario where we are using this class only once
       // why do we want we create this class


       // what we can do is we can directly specify the implementation in the main class


       /*  so whenever you have an object creation like this THE BLOCK AFTER THE OBJECT CREATION IS CALLED AS A CLASS */

       // AND   whenever you have an class inside like this it is called as inner class

       // and since in doesn't have any name it is called as Anonymous Inner Class


       // now we are going to modify this code using the lambda expression in java 8 we have a feature called lambda expression
       // let us learn more about lambda expression in the lession 

       // argument-list , arrow-token and body

        // the main class >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

        // the key features of Lambda Expression are 

        // 1 to provide the implementation of Functional Interface
        // 2 Less Coding
